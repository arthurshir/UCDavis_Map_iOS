<!-- ## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise. -->

## Motivation

This iOS application was a project I started as part of my application for the iOS Developer job position at Creative Media. Note: Code still needs to be restructured and cleaned.

## Installation

Ready to Run after Git Pull.
Due to pods, use xcworkspace file instead of xcodeproj file.
